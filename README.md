# Budget-Tracker-HW

  ## Description
  This is a web application to help track budget. The application saves transactions that you input into an online database. If there is no internet connection, it will save the transactions to cache, until the application is back online. Once the application is back online, it will send in the transactions to be saved in the database.

  Clicking on saved notes on the left side will bring back the saved note's data. To enter in a new note, click on the plus icon on the top right of the screen.
  To delete a saved note, click on the trash icon next to the saved note's title.

  To use the application, go to the [deployed link](https://budget-tracker-el.herokuapp.com/).
  At the top of the page, there is your total budget.
  Fill in the fields required, such as a name for the transaction and the amount.
  To add to your budget, click the add funds button to add the amount of the transaction to your total.
  To subtract from your budget, click on the subtract funds button.
  There is a chart, as well as a graph, that tracks your most recent transactions.
  The application will still work offline as it is stored in the cache. When transactions are entered offline, they are stored in the cache until the application is online.
  Once the application is online again, it will update the database with the entries in the cache.
